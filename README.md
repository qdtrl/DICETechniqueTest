## Use the project

The project is now running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You can now create a route and add waypoints using the form or by clicking directly on the map.

After creating a route, you can edit or delete it by pressing the appropriate button.

If you prefer a less drastic action, you can simply hide the route by clicking on the eye icon.

No need to worry; you can always return to it later if needed. Your data will still be there after reloading the page.
